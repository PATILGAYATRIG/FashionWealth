# FashionWealth
E-commerce Website
FashionWealth is E-commerce website especially in the fashion industry, offer various categories such as clothing, accessories, footwear, and sometimes beauty products. Payment methods commonly accepted include UPI bank transfers, and sometimes cash on delivery depending on the platform's policies and geographical reach.
In this I utilized WooCommerce, a powerful e-commerce plugin for WordPress, which enabled me to implement robust online sales capabilities. For the design aspect, I chose Elementor, a leading WordPress page builder, to ensure the website had a cutting-edge, responsive design. This combination allowed me to craft a user-friendly interface that caters to the needs of modern consumers, making their shopping experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible.
